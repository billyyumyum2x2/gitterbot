If you're interested in coding JavaScript live in front of dozens of people on our popular [twitch.tv channel](http://twitch.tv/freecodecamp), we'd love to have you.

Please follow these steps to get started:

- Follow [this tutorial](http://www.hdpvrcapture.com/wordpress/?p=5951) to set up your computer for streaming.
- Contact [Wesley](https://gitter.im/septimus). He's in charge of our Twitch.tv channel. Tell him what you'd like to stream, and when you're available to stream.
- Wesley will pair with you using [Screen Hero](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/freecodecamp/wiki/How-to-install-Screenhero) to verify your computer is configured properly to stream.

Be respectful of your audience. Everything you stream should be related to coding JavaScript, and should be safe-for-work.

While you're streaming, keep the chat room open so you can respond to questions from your viewers. If we get a new follower, try to thank them.

Play our [camper-DJ'd radio station](http://plug.dj/freecodecamp) in the background.

Use a webcam. If viewers can see your face while you're talking, it will help them feel more connected to you.

Think out-loud as much as possible so that your viewers can understand what you're thinking and doing.

If you do a good job, we'll invite you back to stream some more. Who knows, you might become one of our regular streamers!
